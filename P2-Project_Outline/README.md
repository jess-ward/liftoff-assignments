Happy Meower Project Outline

Happy Hours locator

Overview

Our project will be a web application to search a database of happy hours matching selection criteria (location, distance, day of the week, food and/or drink specials, etc), list the happy hours with links for more details, and a google map plotting matching happy hours.

This project was motivated by Jessica’s background working in bars and restaurants and our love for finding a good happy hour. We also want to provide a place for restaurant owners to share and edit their happy hour options.

Listing: Users will be able to see a list of matching bars/restaurants with links to their websites and additional Happy Hour information.
